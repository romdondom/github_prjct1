"Typical UI testing checklist encompasses the following activities:

    1. Check font (font type and font size)

    2. Check for consistency (colors and visual elements)

    3. Check behavior of interactive elements (do the buttons, clicks, hovers, drag-and-drops, etc. work as intended?)

    4. Check spaces (paddings, borders, margins)

    5. Check page content is as per design (readable font, color, proper text alignment)

    6. Check the page in all standard resolutions (all page layouts are consistent and flawless across devices, ensuring that the UI elements adapt and are displayed correctly in  different sizes)

    7. Check layout (ensure that sections donâ€™t overlap each other)

    8. Check images displayed are not blurry


Of course, complete testing is impossible without the use of special tools. 

There are many applications and methods to increase UI testing quality. 

Our QA Engineers recommend utilizing the following UI testing tools:

    1. PixelPerfect (a very useful tool by  Google Chrome that allows comparing the current version with the provided design)

    2. Dimensions (check interval between contents)

    3. Dev Tools (irreplaceable helper: colors, font (size, type), padding and many others)

    4. Color picker (allows defining the color of the item that you depend on)

    5. Light Snapshot (Quick Screen Preview)
    6. Material. Io Color Tool ( allows selecting the desired color among a large number of shades, and helps you determine the percentage ratio of the background-color combination within it)"
